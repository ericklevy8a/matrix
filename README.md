The Matrix Code Effect

This small project should perhaps be in the canvas repository,
but I wanted to give it its own section now that the movie
it is inspired by is back in trend.

Nothing new, since it is a visual effect that I have already 
seen implemented in the old screensavers for Windows with 
different success. But this time I decided to implement it 
in JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas element and a little 
trick to generate a trail from white to green.

I hope you find it interesting and entertaining as it was for me!
